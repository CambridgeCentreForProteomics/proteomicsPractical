## This repository contains the notebooks for the Part III Systems Biology workshop on Proteomics 

To run the notebooks interactively, as they were intended, you will need to install R and Rstudio:

### Set up
**Install**
[R](https://www.r-project.org/)
[Rstudio](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html)

**R dependencies**
The notebooks depend on the following R packages. 

`tidyr`
`dplyr`
`ggplot2`

The simplest route to install all these is to install the complete "tidyverse": `install.packages("tidyverse")`
